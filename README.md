# 🚨 FraudDetectAI: Real-Time Fraud Detection System

**FraudDetectAI** is an advanced fraud detection system designed to monitor and analyze large-scale financial transaction data in real time. Leveraging state-of-the-art anomaly detection techniques and real-time data processing, FraudDetectAI identifies suspicious activities and helps prevent fraudulent transactions effectively.

## 🌟 Features
- **Real-Time Monitoring:** Continuously analyze transaction data to detect and flag suspicious activities.
- **Anomaly Detection:** Utilize advanced algorithms like Autoencoders and Isolation Forests to identify anomalies.
- **Dynamic Adaptation:** System dynamically adjusts to changing user behavior and transaction patterns.
- **Alerts & Notifications:** Instant alerts for detected fraudulent activities, enabling quick response and mitigation.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Python:** Core language for development.
- **Anomaly Detection Libraries:** Autoencoders and Isolation Forest for detecting unusual transaction patterns.
- **Apache Kafka:** Real-time data streaming and processing.
- **Scikit-Learn & TensorFlow:** For implementing machine learning models.
- **Flask/Django:** For building the API and user interface.

## 📈 How It Works
FraudDetectAI ingests transaction data streams in real-time using Kafka. Transactions are then processed through anomaly detection models to identify potential fraud. Suspicious activities are flagged, and alerts are generated for immediate action. The system continuously learns from new data to enhance its detection capabilities.
